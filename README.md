## Heterogenous Docker Swarms

**Note:** As of April 2015, Docker only supports X86_64 architectures. This project, therefore, seeks to subvert the dominant paradigm.

This project seeks to provide a means for building heterogenous swarms of Docker hosts, such as X86_64 and Raspberry Pi working together in a swarm. It is anticipated that upcoming changes to Docker, such as the ability to add labels, may render this project obsolete. It is our sincere hope that this occurs soon.
