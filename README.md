## Heterogenous Docker Swarms

**Note:** As of April 2015, Docker only supports X86_64 architectures. This project, therefore, seeks to subvert the dominant paradigm.

This project seeks to provide a means for building heterogenous swarms of Docker hosts, such as X86_64 and Raspberry Pi working together in a swarm. It is hoped that upcoming changes to Docker may render this project obsolete. May this occur soon.
